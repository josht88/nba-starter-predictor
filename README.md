# nba-starter-predictor
NBA-Starter-Predictor is a machine-learning project designed to predict whether an NBA player will become a starter within five years based on their rookie-season statistics. It uses logistic regression for classification and K-means clustering for multivariate analysis to identify key statistical indicators that correlate with becoming a starter.
